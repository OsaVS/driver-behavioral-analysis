Analyse habits of drivers using data collected from vehicle OBD port

### Description:
This project analyzes driver habits by collecting real-time data from a vehicle's OBD-II port. Parameters like speed, RPM, throttle position, and braking patterns are gathered using a Bluetooth OBD scanner. This data is used to classify driving behavior (e.g., safe, aggressive, or risky). The goal is to provide feedback that promotes safer, more efficient driving and supports applications like insurance risk profiling and fleet management.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time OBD-II data logging
